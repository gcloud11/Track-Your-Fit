# Track-Your-Fit



This application was created for the user to create, view and track their daily workouts. The user is able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. It allows the user to be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the user can track my distance traveled.
